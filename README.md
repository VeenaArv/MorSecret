# MorSecret

MorSecret was created in 2017 by Veena Arvind, Shannon Chen, and Alice Bian

The purpose of our app is to spread the use of Morse code and allow people to be more fluent in the language.

Description:
Home: Description of the name of the app, its creators, and its purpose.
Manual: Depicts a translation manual of letters and digits into International Morse Code, so users are able to have a reference of the language.
Translate: Users input a word/phrase in English letters or digits, which the app outputs into Morse code in 3 ways: flashlight pulses, sound, and vibration.

SDK version: API8 Android 2.2 (Froyo)

List of xml Files:
We have one main activity called MorSecret_Main, and that is a Java file. Its corresponding xml file is “activity_mor_secret_main.xml”, which includes other fragments that we created (essentially the various tabs). That way, our whole project is linked together under this one main activity. Below is a description of the Java fragments we created in the MorSecret main activity and their respective xml files:
Home_Fragment / home_fragment.xml
Manual_Fragment / manual_fragment.xml
Translate_Fragment / translate_fragment.xml
